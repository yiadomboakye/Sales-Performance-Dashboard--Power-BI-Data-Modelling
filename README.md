# Sales Performance Analysis

### Project Overview

Understanding the key factors that drive success is crucial for analyzing data and delivering meaningful insights to stakeholders and the organization. This project utilizes Power BI to model data and establish relationships between datasets. By creating measures and leveraging DAX functions such as SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR and EOMONTH, the objective is to help the company track and achieve its key performance indicators (KPIs) on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis.
Additionally, the project aims to identify high-performing products, highlight those requiring further attention, and assess the impact of different market segments, regions, and product categories on sales and profitability. It also analyses monthly sales and profit trends, providing strategic recommendations to drive revenue growth and enhance overall business performance.
